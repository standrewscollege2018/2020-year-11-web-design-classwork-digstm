    <h1>France</h1>

<a href="index.html">home</a>

<p>France in the middle of one of its hottest summers on record when we visited</p>
<p>We spent time at the beach in Normandy as well as enjoying plenty of shaded cafes!</p>


<p>Mont St Michel</p>

<p>This famous old monastery is situated on an island and stands out prominently for miles around.</p>
<p>Narrow streets and thousands of tourists made for an overwhelming visit.</p>


<p>Louvre Museum, Paris</p>

<p>Our dose of culture on the trip. We spent hours roaming up and down the seemingless endless halls of art.</p>


<p>Eiffel Tower, Paris

<p>We kept coming back to the Eiffel Tower, enjoying just hanging out in the park around its base.</p>
<p>We also enjoyed going to the top of the tower and the incredible view of Paris, not to mention eating delicious ice cream while up there.</p>
