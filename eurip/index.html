<h2>United Kingdom</h2>

<!-- paragraf if uK -->
<p>I spent a lot of time in the UK, and travelled around as much as I could. Obviously, London was amazing, but there were plenty of other highlights!</p>
<p>We visited lots of churches and castles. The UK is filled with so many historic sights that you could spend years trying to see them all.</p>
